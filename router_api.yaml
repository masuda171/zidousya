          A location defining the origin of the trip.

          ## Format

          Format: `Place[WaypointOptions]`

          * Place: `{lat},{lng}[PlaceOptions]`
          * PlaceOptions: `;option1=<value1>;option2=<value2>...`
          * WaypointOptions: `!option1=<value1>!option2=<value2>...`

          A waypoint consists of:

          * Exactly one place
          * Optional settings for the place
          * Optional settings for the waypoint itself

          ## Supported place options

          * `course`: int, degrees clock-wise from north. Indicating desired direction at the place.
            E.g. `90` indicating `east`. Often combined with `radius` and/or `minCourseDistance`
          * `sideOfStreetHint`: `{lat},{lng}`. Indicating the side of the street that should be
            used. E.g. if the location is to the left of the street, the router will prefer using
            that side in case the street has dividers. E.g.
            `52.511496,13.304140;sideOfStreetHint=52.512149,13.304076` indicates that the `north`
            side of the street should be preferred. This option is required, if `matchSideOfStreet`
            is set to `always`.
            Option cannot be combined with `radius`, `radiusPenalty` or `snapRadius`.
          * `displayLocation`: `{lat},{lng}`. Indicates the location on the map where this POI is to be displayed. This attribute is passed through to the `displayLocation` attribute in the corresponding `Place` object in the output.
          * `uTurnPermission`: enum `[allow, avoid]`. Specifies the U-Turn Permission mode at the stop-over waypoint. If unspecified, the permission will be determined by the global setting, avoid[features]=uTurns. This feature is not supported for pass-through waypoints and U-Turns are generally avoided in that case.
            + `allow` : Allow making a U-Turn at this stop-over waypoint
            + `avoid` : Avoid making a U-Turn at this stop-over waypoint
          * `matchSideOfStreet`: enum `[always, onlyIfDivided]`. Specifies how the location set by
            `sideOfStreetHint` should be handled. Requires `sideOfStreetHint` to be specified as
            well.
            + `always` : Always prefer the given side of street.
            + `onlyIfDivided`: Only prefer using side of street set by `sideOfStreetHint` in case
              the street has dividers. This is the default behavior.
          * `nameHint`: string. Causes the router to look for the place with the most similar name.
            The typical examples include: `North` being used to differentiate between
            interstates `I66 North` and `I66 South`, `Downtown Avenue` being used to correctly
            select a residental street.

            Empty string values are ignored.
          * `radius`: int, meters. Asks the router to consider all places within the given radius as
            potential candidates for route calculation. This can be either because it is not
            important which place is used, or because it is unknown. Radiuses wider than 200 meters are
            not supported.
            Option cannot be combined with `snapRadius`.
          * `radiusPenalty`: int, percentage 0-10000. Penalty as percentage: Used in conjunction with the `radius`
            parameter. Router will match the waypoint within the specified radius and apply a penalty to candidates
            based on their air distance to the waypoint. This penalty is proportional to the given percentage,
            where 100 is just the cost of the air distance, and 200 is twice the cost of the air distance. The penalty
            must be chosen so that, when multiplied by the radius, the result is less than or equal to 7200.
            Regardless, only values up to and including 10000 will be accepted. This means that a maximum penalty
            of 3600% is allowed for a radius of 200m, 7200% for 100m and 10000% for 72m and less.
            Higher values will result in an error response. `radiusPenalty` cannot be combined with `snapRadius`.
            **Alpha**: This parameter is in development. It may not be stable and is subject to change.
          * `snapRadius`: int, meters. Instructs the router to match the waypoint, within the specified radius,
            to the most "significant" road. In contrast to the regular `radius` parameter, `snapRadius` sorts potential
            candidates in order of "significance". For example, a highway is more significant on a zoomed-out map than
            a national road, a national road is more significant than a city road, etc. Hence, `snapRadius` cannot be
            combined with `radius` or `radiusPenalty` parameters. The typical use case for `snapRadius` is when selecting a waypoint on a
            zoomed-out view of a map on a drag-and-drop interface. The expectation on such UIs is that only roads that
            are visible at that zoom level are considered for matching and a large snapRadius would enable that.
          * `minCourseDistance`: int, meters. Instructs the routing service to try to find a route that avoids actions for the indicated distance.
            For example, if the origin is determined by a moving vehicle, the user might not have time to react to early actions.
            Values greater than 2000 meters will be capped at 2000 meters.
          * `customizationIndex`: int. Specifies the zero-based index into the list of customizations
            specified in the `customizations` parameter. The customization at that index must be an
            Extension Map.
            Providing a `customizationIndex` indicates the this waypoint is located within that
            Extension Map.
            **Alpha**: This customization API parameter is in development. It may not be stable and is subject to change.
          * `segmentIdHint`: string. Causes the router to try and match to the specified segment.
            Waypoint coordinates need to be on the segment, otherwise waypoint will be matched ignoring the segment hint
            This parameter can be used when the waypoint is too close to more than one segment to force matching to a specific one.
          * `onRoadThreshold`: int, meters. allows specifying a distance within which
            the waypoint could be considered as being on a highway/bridge/tunnel/sliproad.
            Within this threshold, the attributes of the segments do not impact the matching.
            Outside the threshold only segments which aren't one of highway/bridge/tunnel/sliproad can be matched.

          ## Notes

          * `origin` currently does not support any WaypointOptions. They are available for `via` and `destination` waypoints.
          * Non-structural reserved characters in options' values need to be properly percent-encoded.
            Please refer to the Developer Guide for more details.

        in: query
        description: |
          A location defining a via waypoint.

          A via waypoint is a location between origin and destination. There are two types of via waypoints:
          * `passThrough=false` (default) : The route will stop at the via waypoint, creating a new route section.
          * `passThrough=true` : The route will pass through the via waypoint.

          Multiple waypoints can be specified by using multiple via parameters like
          `via=...&via=...`, in which case the route will traverse these waypoints sequentially in
          the order specified in the request.

          For a description of the format and options for this parameter, please refer to the description of
          the `origin` parameter.
          `via` supports the same options as the `origin` parameter, with the following exceptions:

          ## Additional waypoint options:
          * `stopDuration`: desired duration for the stop, in seconds. Must be less than 50000.
          * `passThrough`: boolean. Default value is `false`.
             Setting to `true` asks the router to avoid the following during route calculation:
            + Introducing a stop at the waypoint.
            + Splitting the route into sections.
            + Changing the direction of travel.

            The following scenarios are not supported for `passThrough` parameter:
            + Setting both `stopDuration` to a value greater than 0 and `passThrough=true`.

          * `charging`: Structured string denoting a user-planned charging stop.

            Format: `charging=(power=<value>;current=<value>;voltage=<value>;supplyType=<value>;minDuration=<value>;maxDuration=<value>)`.

            The properties `power`, `current`, `voltage` and `supplyType` denote the characteristics of the chosen compatible connector at the station. These are all required.
            `minDuration` and `maxDuration` set the time bounds for the charging time. At least one of them is required. For most use cases we recommend to provide at least `minDuration`.
            The following are the specifications for the properties:
            + `power`:        value in kW, type: number. Rated power of the connector.
            + `voltage`:      value in V, type: number. Rated voltage of the connector.
            + `current`:      value in A, type: number. Rated current of the connector.
            + `supplyType`:   one of {"acSingle", "acThree", "dc"} for 1-phase AC, 3-phase AC and DC respectively, type: string.
            + `minDuration`:  value in seconds, type: int. Minimum time the user expects to charge at the station, including `chargingSetupDuration`. This value takes precedence over the global `maxChargingDuration`.
            + `maxDuration`:  value in seconds, type: int. Maximum time the user plans to charge at the station, including `chargingSetupDuration`. This value takes precedence over the global `maxChargingDuration`.

            For a user-planned charging stop, the following properties of the `ev` parameter are also required (see documentation for the `ev` parameter):
            * `initialCharge`
            * `maxCharge`
            * `chargingCurve`

            *Notes*:
              * This option is not supported for pass-through waypoints.
              * If `makeReachable=true` and `minDuration` is not provided (or if `minDuration=0`), route calculation may suggest not to charge on this station, for example,
                if a better station is available in the vicinity.
              * If `stopDuration` is provided then the total time at the stop is the higher of (`stopDuration`, `chargingSetupDuration` + `chargingDuration`).
              * If charging for `minDuration` would charge above `maxCharge`, the time spent charging is capped by `maxCharge`.
              * If `stopDuration` or `minDuration` exceed `chargingSetupDuration` + `chargingDuration`, the `waiting` post action duration is set to the remaining time.
              * If `makeReachable=true` is not set, the target charge is `maxChargeAfterChargingStation`, unless the charging time would be outside of the specified duration range.
                In such case, the nearest valid value is used.
              * In getRoutesByHandle requests, the target charge from the original route response is used, unless the charging time would be outside of the specified duration range.
                In such case, the nearest valid value is used.

          * `currentWeightChange`: Changes the value of `vehicle[currentWeight]` by this value. Enables the support of scenarios where the vehicle takes additional cargo or unloads its cargo along the route. Changes to the configuration of the vehicle, such as adding a trailer, aren't supported.
          Relative value in kilograms, beginning with either `+` or `-`. Available range: from -40000 to +40000 (inclusive).

             If this parameter is specified on any of the via waypoints or the request has the `vehicle[currentWeight]` set, the response contains the `currentWeight` value used for each section.

             When this parameter is provided, both `vehicle[currentWeight]` and `vehicle[grossWeight]` must also be provided.

             If the `currentWeight` value falls below 0 due to `currentWeightChange`, the system returns a critical violation notice, but a route is still calculated. The system returns notices only for negative values. Very low positive values are likely invalid, but don't trigger notices since they are greater than 0.

             The `currentWeightChange` value is stored in the `RouteHandle` at each waypoint and can't be changed in `RouteHandle` calculation requests.

          Specifies which optimization is applied during the calculation.

          * `fast`: Route calculation from start to destination optimized by travel time. In many
            cases, the route returned by `fast` mode may not be the route with the fastest
            possible travel time. For example, the routing service may favor a route that remains on
            a highway, even if a faster travel time can be achieved by taking a detour or shortcut
            through an inconvenient side road.
          * `short`: Route calculation from start to destination disregarding any speed information.
            In this mode, the distance of the route is minimized, while keeping the route sensible.
            This includes, for example, penalizing turns. Because of that, the resulting route will
            not necessarily be the one with minimal distance.

          Avoid roads that violate certain features of road network or that go through
          user-specified areas, segments, or zones.

          Note that if the origin, destination, or any via is in an avoided area or on an avoided
          feature, a route is produced that violates the avoid restriction. In such a case, the
          route is trying to minimize the violation of the avoid restrictions and can therefore
          include large deviations from a route that is calculated without these avoid
          restrictions.

          It is also possible that the produced route violates the avoid restriction in between
          waypoints, if no other route is possible or too hard to find. One such example is
          requesting a route to an island that is only reachable with ferries while specifying
          `avoid[features]=ferry`.

          When using avoid features, it's not guaranteed to get alternatives. Further, they can even
          cause the route calculation to fail, if no route is possible or too hard to find.

             Either a 2D polyline (without `elevation` specified), or a 3D polyline with the 3rd dimension type `Elevation` (with `elevation` specified), using the WGS84 coordinate system.
          * `actions` - Actions (such as maneuvers or tasks) that must be taken to complete the section.
          * `instructions` - Include instructions in returned actions. Instructions are localized to the requested language.
          * `summary` - Include summary for the section.
          * `travelSummary` - Include summary for the travel portion of the section.
          * `turnByTurnActions` - Include all information necessary to support turn by turn guidance to complete the section.
          * `mlDuration` - Use a region-specific machine learning model to calculate route duration.
             **Disclaimer: This parameter is currently in beta release, and is therefore subject to breaking changes.**
          * `typicalDuration` - Include route duration under typical traffic conditions.
          * `elevation` - Include WGS84 elevation information in coordinate and geometry types. See e.g. `polyline` or `location`.
          * `routeHandle` - Encode calculated route and return a handle which can be used with
            `routes/{routeHandle}` to decode the route at a later point in time.
          * `passthrough` - Include information on passthrough via waypoints in the section.
          * `incidents` - Include a list of all incidents applicable to each section.
             Returned incidents may be referenced by `incidents` and/or `intersectionIncidents` span parameters.
             Incidents are localized to the requested language.
          * `routingZones` - Include information about routing zones each section goes through.
          * `truckRoadTypes` - Include information about road types each section goes through.
          * `tolls` - Include information about the tolls to be paid, per section, according to the `tolls` parameter and other toll-influencing
            parameters such as vehicle dimensions in the query,
            e.g `transportMode`, `vehicle[hovOccupancy]`, vehicle[height]. Check the Developer Guide for tutorials on the topic.
            If tolls cannot be calculated for a section, it will contain the `tollsDataUnavailable` notice code.

            **Note**:
              - Toll requests support `car` dimensions such as atypical car height and weight, trailers, axle count and vehicle fuel type. However extreme parameter combinations may result in tolls being returned for a different vehicle type (for example, a car with 6 axles will most likely result in truck tolls).
              Therefore the request will return the most "typical" toll cost for the parameters provided.
              - Tolls are not available in route import service. See [this tutorial](https://www.here.com/docs/bundle/routing-api-developer-guide-v8/page/tutorials/tolls-routeimport.html) for information on how to request tolls when using route import.
          * `routeLabels` - Include a list of the most important names and route numbers on this route that differentiate it from other alternatives
          * `potentialTimeDependentViolations` - Include info notices for potential time-dependent violations in the sections that match the current vehicle profile, but are not violating the restricted times for the calculated route.
          * `noThroughRestrictions` - Include information about the parts of the route that are not allowed to be driven through, i.e. route can only start, end, or have an intermediate `via` waypoint here.

          The following restrictions apply when specifying the `return` parameter:

          * If `actions` is requested, then `polyline` must also be requested as well.
          * If `instructions` is requested, then `actions` must also be requested as well.
          * If `turnByTurnActions` is requested, then `polyline` must also be requested as well.

          A location defining the origin of the trip.

          ## Format

          Format: `Place[WaypointOptions]`

          * Place: `{lat},{lng}[PlaceOptions]`
          * PlaceOptions: `;option1=<value1>;option2=<value2>...`
          * WaypointOptions: `!option1=<value1>!option2=<value2>...`

          A waypoint consists of:

          * Exactly one place
          * Optional settings for the place
          * Optional settings for the waypoint itself

          ## Supported place options

          * `course`: int, degrees clock-wise from north. Indicating desired direction at the place.
            E.g. `90` indicating `east`. Often combined with `radius` and/or `minCourseDistance`
          * `sideOfStreetHint`: `{lat},{lng}`. Indicating the side of the street that should be
            used. E.g. if the location is to the left of the street, the router will prefer using
            that side in case the street has dividers. E.g.
            `52.511496,13.304140;sideOfStreetHint=52.512149,13.304076` indicates that the `north`
            side of the street should be preferred. This option is required, if `matchSideOfStreet`
            is set to `always`.
            Option cannot be combined with `radius`, `radiusPenalty` or `snapRadius`.
          * `displayLocation`: `{lat},{lng}`. Indicates the location on the map where this POI is to be displayed. This attribute is passed through to the `displayLocation` attribute in the corresponding `Place` object in the output.
          * `uTurnPermission`: enum `[allow, avoid]`. Specifies the U-Turn Permission mode at the stop-over waypoint. If unspecified, the permission will be determined by the global setting, avoid[features]=uTurns. This feature is not supported for pass-through waypoints and U-Turns are generally avoided in that case.
            + `allow` : Allow making a U-Turn at this stop-over waypoint
            + `avoid` : Avoid making a U-Turn at this stop-over waypoint
          * `matchSideOfStreet`: enum `[always, onlyIfDivided]`. Specifies how the location set by
            `sideOfStreetHint` should be handled. Requires `sideOfStreetHint` to be specified as
            well.
            + `always` : Always prefer the given side of street.
            + `onlyIfDivided`: Only prefer using side of street set by `sideOfStreetHint` in case
              the street has dividers. This is the default behavior.
          * `nameHint`: string. Causes the router to look for the place with the most similar name.
            The typical examples include: `North` being used to differentiate between
            interstates `I66 North` and `I66 South`, `Downtown Avenue` being used to correctly
            select a residental street.

            Empty string values are ignored.
          * `radius`: int, meters. Asks the router to consider all places within the given radius as
            potential candidates for route calculation. This can be either because it is not
            important which place is used, or because it is unknown. Radiuses wider than 200 meters are
            not supported.
            Option cannot be combined with `snapRadius`.
          * `radiusPenalty`: int, percentage 0-10000. Penalty as percentage: Used in conjunction with the `radius`
            parameter. Router will match the waypoint within the specified radius and apply a penalty to candidates
            based on their air distance to the waypoint. This penalty is proportional to the given percentage,
            where 100 is just the cost of the air distance, and 200 is twice the cost of the air distance. The penalty
            must be chosen so that, when multiplied by the radius, the result is less than or equal to 7200.
            Regardless, only values up to and including 10000 will be accepted. This means that a maximum penalty
            of 3600% is allowed for a radius of 200m, 7200% for 100m and 10000% for 72m and less.
            Higher values will result in an error response. `radiusPenalty` cannot be combined with `snapRadius`.
            **Alpha**: This parameter is in development. It may not be stable and is subject to change.
          * `snapRadius`: int, meters. Instructs the router to match the waypoint, within the specified radius,
            to the most "significant" road. In contrast to the regular `radius` parameter, `snapRadius` sorts potential
            candidates in order of "significance". For example, a highway is more significant on a zoomed-out map than
            a national road, a national road is more significant than a city road, etc. Hence, `snapRadius` cannot be
            combined with `radius` or `radiusPenalty` parameters. The typical use case for `snapRadius` is when selecting a waypoint on a
            zoomed-out view of a map on a drag-and-drop interface. The expectation on such UIs is that only roads that
            are visible at that zoom level are considered for matching and a large snapRadius would enable that.
          * `minCourseDistance`: int, meters. Instructs the routing service to try to find a route that avoids actions for the indicated distance.
            For example, if the origin is determined by a moving vehicle, the user might not have time to react to early actions.
            Values greater than 2000 meters will be capped at 2000 meters.
          * `customizationIndex`: int. Specifies the zero-based index into the list of customizations
            specified in the `customizations` parameter. The customization at that index must be an
            Extension Map.
            Providing a `customizationIndex` indicates the this waypoint is located within that
            Extension Map.
            **Alpha**: This customization API parameter is in development. It may not be stable and is subject to change.
          * `segmentIdHint`: string. Causes the router to try and match to the specified segment.
            Waypoint coordinates need to be on the segment, otherwise waypoint will be matched ignoring the segment hint
            This parameter can be used when the waypoint is too close to more than one segment to force matching to a specific one.
          * `onRoadThreshold`: int, meters. allows specifying a distance within which
            the waypoint could be considered as being on a highway/bridge/tunnel/sliproad.
            Within this threshold, the attributes of the segments do not impact the matching.
            Outside the threshold only segments which aren't one of highway/bridge/tunnel/sliproad can be matched.

          ## Notes

          * `origin` currently does not support any WaypointOptions. They are available for `via` and `destination` waypoints.
          * Non-structural reserved characters in options' values need to be properly percent-encoded.
            Please refer to the Developer Guide for more details.

        in: query
        description: |
          A location defining a via waypoint.

          A via waypoint is a location between origin and destination. There are two types of via waypoints:
          * `passThrough=false` (default) : The route will stop at the via waypoint, creating a new route section.
          * `passThrough=true` : The route will pass through the via waypoint.

          Multiple waypoints can be specified by using multiple via parameters like
          `via=...&via=...`, in which case the route will traverse these waypoints sequentially in
          the order specified in the request.

          For a description of the format and options for this parameter, please refer to the description of
          the `origin` parameter.
          `via` supports the same options as the `origin` parameter, with the following exceptions:

          ## Additional waypoint options:
          * `stopDuration`: desired duration for the stop, in seconds. Must be less than 50000.
          * `passThrough`: boolean. Default value is `false`.
             Setting to `true` asks the router to avoid the following during route calculation:
            + Introducing a stop at the waypoint.
            + Splitting the route into sections.
            + Changing the direction of travel.

            The following scenarios are not supported for `passThrough` parameter:
            + Setting both `stopDuration` to a value greater than 0 and `passThrough=true`.

          * `charging`: Structured string denoting a user-planned charging stop.

            Format: `charging=(power=<value>;current=<value>;voltage=<value>;supplyType=<value>;minDuration=<value>;maxDuration=<value>)`.

            The properties `power`, `current`, `voltage` and `supplyType` denote the characteristics of the chosen compatible connector at the station. These are all required.
            `minDuration` and `maxDuration` set the time bounds for the charging time. At least one of them is required. For most use cases we recommend to provide at least `minDuration`.
            The following are the specifications for the properties:
            + `power`:        value in kW, type: number. Rated power of the connector.
            + `voltage`:      value in V, type: number. Rated voltage of the connector.
            + `current`:      value in A, type: number. Rated current of the connector.
            + `supplyType`:   one of {"acSingle", "acThree", "dc"} for 1-phase AC, 3-phase AC and DC respectively, type: string.
            + `minDuration`:  value in seconds, type: int. Minimum time the user expects to charge at the station, including `chargingSetupDuration`. This value takes precedence over the global `maxChargingDuration`.
            + `maxDuration`:  value in seconds, type: int. Maximum time the user plans to charge at the station, including `chargingSetupDuration`. This value takes precedence over the global `maxChargingDuration`.

            For a user-planned charging stop, the following properties of the `ev` parameter are also required (see documentation for the `ev` parameter):
            * `initialCharge`
            * `maxCharge`
            * `chargingCurve`

            *Notes*:
              * This option is not supported for pass-through waypoints.
              * If `makeReachable=true` and `minDuration` is not provided (or if `minDuration=0`), route calculation may suggest not to charge on this station, for example,
                if a better station is available in the vicinity.
              * If `stopDuration` is provided then the total time at the stop is the higher of (`stopDuration`, `chargingSetupDuration` + `chargingDuration`).
              * If charging for `minDuration` would charge above `maxCharge`, the time spent charging is capped by `maxCharge`.
              * If `stopDuration` or `minDuration` exceed `chargingSetupDuration` + `chargingDuration`, the `waiting` post action duration is set to the remaining time.
              * If `makeReachable=true` is not set, the target charge is `maxChargeAfterChargingStation`, unless the charging time would be outside of the specified duration range.
                In such case, the nearest valid value is used.
              * In getRoutesByHandle requests, the target charge from the original route response is used, unless the charging time would be outside of the specified duration range.
                In such case, the nearest valid value is used.

          * `currentWeightChange`: Changes the value of `vehicle[currentWeight]` by this value. Enables the support of scenarios where the vehicle takes additional cargo or unloads its cargo along the route. Changes to the configuration of the vehicle, such as adding a trailer, aren't supported.
          Relative value in kilograms, beginning with either `+` or `-`. Available range: from -40000 to +40000 (inclusive).

             If this parameter is specified on any of the via waypoints or the request has the `vehicle[currentWeight]` set, the response contains the `currentWeight` value used for each section.

             When this parameter is provided, both `vehicle[currentWeight]` and `vehicle[grossWeight]` must also be provided.

             If the `currentWeight` value falls below 0 due to `currentWeightChange`, the system returns a critical violation notice, but a route is still calculated. The system returns notices only for negative values. Very low positive values are likely invalid, but don't trigger notices since they are greater than 0.

             The `currentWeightChange` value is stored in the `RouteHandle` at each waypoint and can't be changed in `RouteHandle` calculation requests.

          Avoid roads that violate certain features of road network or that go through

          Note that if the origin, destination, or any via is in an avoided area or on an avoided
          feature, a route is produced that violates the avoid restriction. In such a case, the
          route is trying to minimize the violation of the avoid restrictions and can therefore
          include large deviations from a route that is calculated without these avoid
          restrictions.

          It is also possible that the produced route violates the avoid restriction in between
          waypoints, if no other route is possible or too hard to find. One such example is
          requesting a route to an island that is only reachable with ferries while specifying
          `avoid[features]=ferry`.

          When using avoid features, it's not guaranteed to get alternatives. Further, they can even

             Either a 2D polyline (without `elevation` specified), or a 3D polyline with the 3rd dimension type `Elevation` (with `elevation` specified), using the WGS84 coordinate system.
          * `actions` - Actions (such as maneuvers or tasks) that must be taken to complete the section.
          * `instructions` - Include instructions in returned actions. Instructions are localized to the requested language.
          * `summary` - Include summary for the section.
          * `travelSummary` - Include summary for the travel portion of the section.
          * `turnByTurnActions` - Include all information necessary to support turn by turn guidance to complete the section.
          * `mlDuration` - Use a region-specific machine learning model to calculate route duration.
             **Disclaimer: This parameter is currently in beta release, and is therefore subject to breaking changes.**
          * `typicalDuration` - Include route duration under typical traffic conditions.
          * `elevation` - Include WGS84 elevation information in coordinate and geometry types. See e.g. `polyline` or `location`.
          * `routeHandle` - Encode calculated route and return a handle which can be used with
            `routes/{routeHandle}` to decode the route at a later point in time.
          * `passthrough` - Include information on passthrough via waypoints in the section.
          * `incidents` - Include a list of all incidents applicable to each section.
             Returned incidents may be referenced by `incidents` and/or `intersectionIncidents` span parameters.
             Incidents are localized to the requested language.
          * `routingZones` - Include information about routing zones each section goes through.
          * `truckRoadTypes` - Include information about road types each section goes through.
          * `tolls` - Include information about the tolls to be paid, per section, according to the `tolls` parameter and other toll-influencing
            parameters such as vehicle dimensions in the query,
            e.g `transportMode`, `vehicle[hovOccupancy]`, vehicle[height]. Check the Developer Guide for tutorials on the topic.
            If tolls cannot be calculated for a section, it will contain the `tollsDataUnavailable` notice code.

            **Note**:
              - Toll requests support `car` dimensions such as atypical car height and weight, trailers, axle count and vehicle fuel type. However extreme parameter combinations may result in tolls being returned for a different vehicle type (for example, a car with 6 axles will most likely result in truck tolls).
              Therefore the request will return the most "typical" toll cost for the parameters provided.
              - Tolls are not available in route import service. See [this tutorial](https://www.here.com/docs/bundle/routing-api-developer-guide-v8/page/tutorials/tolls-routeimport.html) for information on how to request tolls when using route import.
          * `routeLabels` - Include a list of the most important names and route numbers on this route that differentiate it from other alternatives
          * `potentialTimeDependentViolations` - Include info notices for potential time-dependent violations in the sections that match the current vehicle profile, but are not violating the restricted times for the calculated route.
          * `noThroughRestrictions` - Include information about the parts of the route that are not allowed to be driven through, i.e. route can only start, end, or have an intermediate `via` waypoint here.

          The following restrictions apply when specifying the `return` parameter:

          * If `actions` is requested, then `polyline` must also be requested as well.
          * If `instructions` is requested, then `actions` must also be requested as well.
          * If `turnByTurnActions` is requested, then `polyline` must also be requested as well.

      summary: Get route by handle via GET

        Decodes and returns a route from a previously calculated route handle.

        **Disclaimer: A route handle is not suitable for persistent route storage! It can be
        invalidated at any time.**

        A route handle encodes a previously calculated route. A route can be decoded from a handle
        as long as the service uses the same map data and encoding that were used when retrieving the handle.

        Thus it is suitable for caching routes compactly. It can be used to retrieve updated traffic
        information or other data along the route. However, a user should be prepared to recalculate
        the route when decoding the handle fails.

        All parameters of the `/routes` endpoint are supported, except for `destination`, `via`,
        `alternatives` and `routingMode`. See also the `return` parameter of `/routes` endpoint.

        The `origin` parameter can be provided to update the start of the previously calculated
        route.

        The `transportMode` parameter does not have to match the transport mode previously used for
        route calculation. However, when using a different transport mode, the request may fail,
        e.g. when the route has road segments forbidden for the provided transport mode.

        Please refer to the Developer Guide for more information and examples.

          Avoid roads that violate certain features of road network or that go through
          user-specified areas, segments, or zones.

          Note that if the origin, destination, or any via is in an avoided area or on an avoided
          feature, a route is produced that violates the avoid restriction. In such a case, the
          route is trying to minimize the violation of the avoid restrictions and can therefore
          include large deviations from a route that is calculated without these avoid
          restrictions.

          It is also possible that the produced route violates the avoid restriction in between
          waypoints, if no other route is possible or too hard to find. One such example is
          requesting a route to an island that is only reachable with ferries while specifying
          `avoid[features]=ferry`.

          When using avoid features, it's not guaranteed to get alternatives. Further, they can even
          cause the route calculation to fail, if no route is possible or too hard to find.

          * `polyline` - Polyline for the route in [Flexible Polyline](https://github.com/heremaps/flexible-polyline) Encoding.
             Either a 2D polyline (without `elevation` specified), or a 3D polyline with the 3rd dimension type `Elevation` (with `elevation` specified), using the WGS84 coordinate system.
          * `actions` - Actions (such as maneuvers or tasks) that must be taken to complete the section.
          * `instructions` - Include instructions in returned actions. Instructions are localized to the requested language.
          * `summary` - Include summary for the section.
          * `travelSummary` - Include summary for the travel portion of the section.
          * `turnByTurnActions` - Include all information necessary to support turn by turn guidance to complete the section.
          * `mlDuration` - Use a region-specific machine learning model to calculate route duration.
             **Disclaimer: This parameter is currently in beta release, and is therefore subject to breaking changes.**
          * `typicalDuration` - Include route duration under typical traffic conditions.
          * `elevation` - Include WGS84 elevation information in coordinate and geometry types. See e.g. `polyline` or `location`.
          * `routeHandle` - Encode calculated route and return a handle which can be used with
            `routes/{routeHandle}` to decode the route at a later point in time.
          * `passthrough` - Include information on passthrough via waypoints in the section.
          * `incidents` - Include a list of all incidents applicable to each section.
             Returned incidents may be referenced by `incidents` and/or `intersectionIncidents` span parameters.
             Incidents are localized to the requested language.
          * `routingZones` - Include information about routing zones each section goes through.
          * `truckRoadTypes` - Include information about road types each section goes through.
          * `tolls` - Include information about the tolls to be paid, per section, according to the `tolls` parameter and other toll-influencing
            parameters such as vehicle dimensions in the query,
            e.g `transportMode`, `vehicle[hovOccupancy]`, vehicle[height]. Check the Developer Guide for tutorials on the topic.
            If tolls cannot be calculated for a section, it will contain the `tollsDataUnavailable` notice code.

            **Note**:
              - Toll requests support `car` dimensions such as atypical car height and weight, trailers, axle count and vehicle fuel type. However extreme parameter combinations may result in tolls being returned for a different vehicle type (for example, a car with 6 axles will most likely result in truck tolls).
              Therefore the request will return the most "typical" toll cost for the parameters provided.
              - Tolls are not available in route import service. See [this tutorial](https://www.here.com/docs/bundle/routing-api-developer-guide-v8/page/tutorials/tolls-routeimport.html) for information on how to request tolls when using route import.
          * `routeLabels` - Include a list of the most important names and route numbers on this route that differentiate it from other alternatives
          * `potentialTimeDependentViolations` - Include info notices for potential time-dependent violations in the sections that match the current vehicle profile, but are not violating the restricted times for the calculated route.
          * `noThroughRestrictions` - Include information about the parts of the route that are not allowed to be driven through, i.e. route can only start, end, or have an intermediate `via` waypoint here.

          The following restrictions apply when specifying the `return` parameter:

          * If `actions` is requested, then `polyline` must also be requested as well.
          * If `instructions` is requested, then `actions` must also be requested as well.
          * If `turnByTurnActions` is requested, then `polyline` must also be requested as well.
          * If at least one attribute is requested within the `spans` parameter, then `polyline` must be request as well

      summary: Get route by handle via POST
      description: |
        Decodes and returns a route from a previously calculated route handle.

        **Disclaimer: A route handle is not suitable for persistent route storage! It can be
        invalidated at any time.**

        A route handle encodes a previously calculated route. A route can be decoded from a handle
        as long as the service uses the same map data and encoding that were used when retrieving the handle.

        Thus it is suitable for caching routes compactly. It can be used to retrieve updated traffic
        information or other data along the route. However, a user should be prepared to recalculate
        the route when decoding the handle fails.

        All parameters of the `/routes` endpoint are supported, except for `destination`, `via`,
        `alternatives` and `routingMode`. See also the `return` parameter of `/routes` endpoint.

        The `origin` parameter can be provided to update the start of the previously calculated
        route.

        The `transportMode` parameter does not have to match the transport mode previously used for
        route calculation. However, when using a different transport mode, the request may fail,
        e.g. when the route has road segments forbidden for the provided transport mode.

        Only selected parameters are permitted in the POST body. See the request body section below for details.
        If a parameter is provided in both the query string and the POST body, their values are merged.

        Post body size limit is 10MiB.

        Please refer to the Developer Guide for more information and examples.

          Avoid roads that violate certain features of road network or that go through
          user-specified areas, segments, or zones.

          Note that if the origin, destination, or any via is in an avoided area or on an avoided
          feature, a route is produced that violates the avoid restriction. In such a case, the
          route is trying to minimize the violation of the avoid restrictions and can therefore
          include large deviations from a route that is calculated without these avoid
          restrictions.

          It is also possible that the produced route violates the avoid restriction in between
          waypoints, if no other route is possible or too hard to find. One such example is
          requesting a route to an island that is only reachable with ferries while specifying
          `avoid[features]=ferry`.

          When using avoid features, it's not guaranteed to get alternatives. Further, they can even
          cause the route calculation to fail, if no route is possible or too hard to find.

             Either a 2D polyline (without `elevation` specified), or a 3D polyline with the 3rd dimension type `Elevation` (with `elevation` specified), using the WGS84 coordinate system.
          * `actions` - Actions (such as maneuvers or tasks) that must be taken to complete the section.
          * `instructions` - Include instructions in returned actions. Instructions are localized to the requested language.
          * `summary` - Include summary for the section.
          * `travelSummary` - Include summary for the travel portion of the section.
          * `turnByTurnActions` - Include all information necessary to support turn by turn guidance to complete the section.
          * `mlDuration` - Use a region-specific machine learning model to calculate route duration.
             **Disclaimer: This parameter is currently in beta release, and is therefore subject to breaking changes.**
          * `typicalDuration` - Include route duration under typical traffic conditions.
          * `elevation` - Include WGS84 elevation information in coordinate and geometry types. See e.g. `polyline` or `location`.
          * `routeHandle` - Encode calculated route and return a handle which can be used with
            `routes/{routeHandle}` to decode the route at a later point in time.
          * `passthrough` - Include information on passthrough via waypoints in the section.
          * `incidents` - Include a list of all incidents applicable to each section.
             Returned incidents may be referenced by `incidents` and/or `intersectionIncidents` span parameters.
             Incidents are localized to the requested language.
          * `routingZones` - Include information about routing zones each section goes through.
          * `truckRoadTypes` - Include information about road types each section goes through.
          * `tolls` - Include information about the tolls to be paid, per section, according to the `tolls` parameter and other toll-influencing
            parameters such as vehicle dimensions in the query,
            e.g `transportMode`, `vehicle[hovOccupancy]`, vehicle[height]. Check the Developer Guide for tutorials on the topic.
            If tolls cannot be calculated for a section, it will contain the `tollsDataUnavailable` notice code.

            **Note**:
              - Toll requests support `car` dimensions such as atypical car height and weight, trailers, axle count and vehicle fuel type. However extreme parameter combinations may result in tolls being returned for a different vehicle type (for example, a car with 6 axles will most likely result in truck tolls).
              Therefore the request will return the most "typical" toll cost for the parameters provided.
              - Tolls are not available in route import service. See [this tutorial](https://www.here.com/docs/bundle/routing-api-developer-guide-v8/page/tutorials/tolls-routeimport.html) for information on how to request tolls when using route import.
          * `routeLabels` - Include a list of the most important names and route numbers on this route that differentiate it from other alternatives

        Creates a route from a sequence of trace points.

        Post body size limit is 10MiB.

        For best results, use 1Hz GPS data or any points that have a spacing of a few meters between them.
        For traces with less frequent points, the Route Import service will attempt to create an approximate reconstruction.
        In some situations, when consecutive points are too far apart (more than about 30 kilometers of on-road distance), they could be considered unreachable and one of them could fail to be matched.

          Avoid roads that violate certain features of road network or that go through

          Note that if the origin, destination, or any via is in an avoided area or on an avoided
          feature, a route is produced that violates the avoid restriction. In such a case, the
          route is trying to minimize the violation of the avoid restrictions and can therefore
          include large deviations from a route that is calculated without these avoid
          restrictions.

          It is also possible that the produced route violates the avoid restriction in between
          waypoints, if no other route is possible or too hard to find. One such example is
          requesting a route to an island that is only reachable with ferries while specifying
          `avoid[features]=ferry`.

          When using avoid features, it's not guaranteed to get alternatives. Further, they can even

          * `polyline` - Polyline for the route in [Flexible Polyline](https://github.com/heremaps/flexible-polyline) Encoding.
             Either a 2D polyline (without `elevation` specified), or a 3D polyline with the 3rd dimension type `Elevation` (with `elevation` specified), using the WGS84 coordinate system.
          * `actions` - Actions (such as maneuvers or tasks) that must be taken to complete the section.
          * `instructions` - Include instructions in returned actions. Instructions are localized to the requested language.
          * `summary` - Include summary for the section.
          * `travelSummary` - Include summary for the travel portion of the section.
          * `turnByTurnActions` - Include all information necessary to support turn by turn guidance to complete the section.
          * `mlDuration` - Use a region-specific machine learning model to calculate route duration.
             **Disclaimer: This parameter is currently in beta release, and is therefore subject to breaking changes.**
          * `typicalDuration` - Include route duration under typical traffic conditions.
          * `elevation` - Include WGS84 elevation information in coordinate and geometry types. See e.g. `polyline` or `location`.
          * `routeHandle` - Encode calculated route and return a handle which can be used with
            `routes/{routeHandle}` to decode the route at a later point in time.
          * `passthrough` - Include information on passthrough via waypoints in the section.
          * `incidents` - Include a list of all incidents applicable to each section.
             Returned incidents may be referenced by `incidents` and/or `intersectionIncidents` span parameters.
             Incidents are localized to the requested language.
          * `routingZones` - Include information about routing zones each section goes through.
          * `truckRoadTypes` - Include information about road types each section goes through.
          * `tolls` - Include information about the tolls to be paid, per section, according to the `tolls` parameter and other toll-influencing
            parameters such as vehicle dimensions in the query,
            e.g `transportMode`, `vehicle[hovOccupancy]`, vehicle[height]. Check the Developer Guide for tutorials on the topic.
            If tolls cannot be calculated for a section, it will contain the `tollsDataUnavailable` notice code.

            **Note**:
              - Toll requests support `car` dimensions such as atypical car height and weight, trailers, axle count and vehicle fuel type. However extreme parameter combinations may result in tolls being returned for a different vehicle type (for example, a car with 6 axles will most likely result in truck tolls).
              Therefore the request will return the most "typical" toll cost for the parameters provided.
              - Tolls are not available in route import service. See [this tutorial](https://www.here.com/docs/bundle/routing-api-developer-guide-v8/page/tutorials/tolls-routeimport.html) for information on how to request tolls when using route import.
          * `routeLabels` - Include a list of the most important names and route numbers on this route that differentiate it from other alternatives
          * `potentialTimeDependentViolations` - Include info notices for potential time-dependent violations in the sections that match the current vehicle profile, but are not violating the restricted times for the calculated route.
          * `noThroughRestrictions` - Include information about the parts of the route that are not allowed to be driven through, i.e. route can only start, end, or have an intermediate `via` waypoint here.

          The following restrictions apply when specifying the `return` parameter:

          * If `actions` is requested, then `polyline` must also be requested as well.
          * If `instructions` is requested, then `actions` must also be requested as well.
          * If `turnByTurnActions` is requested, then `polyline` must also be requested as well.

          The following `ev` properties are additionally required in order to calculate State-of-Charge along the route:
          * `initialCharge`
          * `maxCharge`

          Route reachability based on State-of-Charge will be evaluated for the following constraints, if additionally provided,
          * `minChargeAtDestination`
          * `minChargeAtFirstChargingStation`

          The following properties are additionally required in order to calculate charging at charging station waypoints (see documentation for `via` parameter)
          * `chargingCurve`

          **Notes**:
          * Hybrid vehicles (EV + Other fuel types) are not supported. Consumption properties are not supported for combination of `ev` and `fuel` vehicles.
          * EV parameters are not supported in combination with pedestrian and bicycle `transportMode`.

            This parameter specifies whether HOV lanes can be used in the calculation.

            An HOV (High occupancy Vehicle) lane or carpool lane is reserved for carpool usage.
            Carpool lane requires a minimum number of passengers in order for the car to use the
            carpool lane.

            **Notes**:
            - This parameter can't be used with 'vehicle[hovOccupancy]'.
            - This parameter should be used with `vehicle[occupancy]`. If `vehicle[occupancy]` is set, then only HOV lanes allowing this number of occupants will be allowed. If `vehicle[occupancy]` is not set, occupancy requirements are always considered fulfilled.
            - In case of violation, `violatedCarpool` notice will be returned.

            **Notes**:
            - This parameter can't be used with 'vehicle[hovOccupancy]'.
            - This parameter can be used with `allow[hov]`.
            - In case of violation, `violatedCarpool` notice will be returned.

            A comma separated list of duration pairs in seconds. Each pair is two positive non-zero integers.
            The first specifies the maximum allowed drive duration before stopping to rest, and the second the resting duration before continuing driving.

            Format `driveDuration,restDuration[,driveDuration,restDuration]...`

            * driveDuration - duration in seconds, describes maximum driving duration allowed in a route's section
              till the next stop or route end. Minimum value is 240.
            * restDuration - duration in seconds, describes minimum resting duration required before continuing driving

            The routing engine adds necessary stops for rest to fulfill driver work hours requirements.
            If the route duration exceeds the defined drive-rest sequence the remaining route is added as the last drive section
            (or several sections if there are `via` waypoints on the remaining route) with critical notice `travelTimeExceedsDriverWorkHours`.

            **Limitations**:
            * `driver[schedule]` is only supported for `truck`, `bus` and `privateBus` transport modes.
            * `driver[schedule]` is not supported in combination with any of these parameters: `arrivalTime`, `ev[*]`.
            * `driver[schedule]` doesn't support route alternatives. So `alternatives` parameter value is ignored in combination with `driver[schedule]`.
            * Ferry travel, boarding, and deboarding durations are neither considered part of drive duration nor rest duration unless ferry
              travel duration is below 15 minutes. In this case, ferry travel duration is considered as drive duration.
            * Via waypoint stop-durations are neither considered part of drive duration nor rest duration.
            * Routing requires a minimum driving duration (`driveDuration`) of 240 seconds before a rest stop.

        route after the current position. If the current position, i.e., the new `origin`, is defined and is
        outside of the original route then the request will fail. If both `origin` and

        `lastTraveledSectionIndex` and `traveledDistanceOnLastSection` will be applied first, and
        then `origin` will be matched to the part of the route that's left. This is the default behavior.
        * `returnToRoute` - Same as `none` if current position is on the route. If the current
        position is not on the original route then a new route to the destination will be
        calculated, starting from the current position. The new route will try to preserve the shape
        of the original route, if possible. If a new optimal route is found before a route back to
        the original route then the new route will be returned.

      description: |
        Defines which attributes are included in the response as part of data representation of a
        `Route` or `Section`.

        * `polyline` - Polyline for the route in [Flexible Polyline](https://github.com/heremaps/flexible-polyline) Encoding.
           Either a 2D polyline (without `elevation` specified), or a 3D polyline with the 3rd dimension type `Elevation` (with `elevation` specified), using the WGS84 coordinate system.
        * `actions` - Actions (such as maneuvers or tasks) that must be taken to complete the section.
        * `instructions` - Include instructions in returned actions. Instructions are localized to the requested language.
        * `summary` - Include summary for the section.
        * `travelSummary` - Include summary for the travel portion of the section.
        * `turnByTurnActions` - Include all information necessary to support turn by turn guidance to complete the section.
        * `mlDuration` - Use a region-specific machine learning model to calculate route duration.
           **Disclaimer: This parameter is currently in beta release, and is therefore subject to breaking changes.**
        * `typicalDuration` - Include route duration under typical traffic conditions.
        * `elevation` - Include WGS84 elevation information in coordinate and geometry types. See e.g. `polyline` or `location`.
        * `routeHandle` - Encode calculated route and return a handle which can be used with
          `routes/{routeHandle}` to decode the route at a later point in time.
        * `passthrough` - Include information on passthrough via waypoints in the section.
        * `incidents` - Include a list of all incidents applicable to each section.
           Returned incidents may be referenced by `incidents` and/or `intersectionIncidents` span parameters.
           Incidents are localized to the requested language.
        * `routingZones` - Include information about routing zones each section goes through.
        * `truckRoadTypes` - Include information about road types each section goes through.
        * `tolls` - Include information about the tolls to be paid, per section, according to the `tolls` parameter and other toll-influencing
          parameters such as vehicle dimensions in the query,
          e.g `transportMode`, `vehicle[hovOccupancy]`, vehicle[height]. Check the Developer Guide for tutorials on the topic.
          If tolls cannot be calculated for a section, it will contain the `tollsDataUnavailable` notice code.

          **Note**:
            - Toll requests support `car` dimensions such as atypical car height and weight, trailers, axle count and vehicle fuel type. However extreme parameter combinations may result in tolls being returned for a different vehicle type (for example, a car with 6 axles will most likely result in truck tolls).
            Therefore the request will return the most "typical" toll cost for the parameters provided.
            - Tolls are not available in route import service. See [this tutorial](https://www.here.com/docs/bundle/routing-api-developer-guide-v8/page/tutorials/tolls-routeimport.html) for information on how to request tolls when using route import.
        * `routeLabels` - Include a list of the most important names and route numbers on this route that differentiate it from other alternatives
        * `potentialTimeDependentViolations` - Include info notices for potential time-dependent violations in the sections that match the current vehicle profile, but are not violating the restricted times for the calculated route.
        * `noThroughRestrictions` - Include information about the parts of the route that are not allowed to be driven through, i.e. route can only start, end, or have an intermediate `via` waypoint here.

        The following restrictions apply when specifying the `return` parameter:

        * If `actions` is requested, then `polyline` must also be requested as well.
        * If `instructions` is requested, then `actions` must also be requested as well.
        * If `turnByTurnActions` is requested, then `polyline` must also be requested as well.
        * If at least one attribute is requested within the `spans` parameter, then `polyline` must be request as well

          cases, the route returned by `fast` mode may not be the route with the fastest
          possible travel time. For example, the routing service may favor a route that remains on
          a highway, even if a faster travel time can be achieved by taking a detour or shortcut
          through an inconvenient side road.
        * `short`: Route calculation from start to destination disregarding any speed information.
          In this mode, the distance of the route is minimized, while keeping the route sensible.
          This includes, for example, penalizing turns. Because of that, the resulting route will
          not necessarily be the one with minimal distance.

    RoutingZoneReference:

        A reference to a routing zone in HMC.

        The standard representation of a routing zone reference has the following structure:
        `{catalogHrn}:{catalogVersion}:({layerId})?:{tileId}:{zoneId}`

        The individual parts are:
        * `catalogHrn`: The HERE Resource Name that identifies the source catalog of the routing zone, example: `hrn:here:data::olp-here:rib-2`
        * `catalogVersion`: The catalog version
        * `layerId` (optional): The layer inside the catalog where the routing zone is located, example: `environmental-zones`
        * `tileId`: The HERE tile key of the partition/tile where the routing zone is located in the given version of the catalog
        * `zoneId`: The identifier of the referenced routing zone within the catalog, example: `here:cm:envzone:3455277`

        Example of a reference to an environmental zone in standard form:
        `hrn:here:data::olp-here:rib-2:1557:environmental-zones:all:here:cm:envzone:3455277`

        In order to reduce response size, routing zone references can also be provided in a compact representation.
        In compact form, parts of a reference are replaced by placeholders, which can be resolved using the `refReplacements` dictionary in the parent section.
        The placeholder format is ```\$\d+``` and needs to be surrounded by colons or string start/end. It can be captured with the following regular expression: ```(^|:)\$\d+(:|$)``` .

        Example of the aforementioned environmental zone reference in compact form: `$0:$1:3455277`
        With the corresponding `refReplacements`:

    SegmentRef:

        A reference to the HMC topology segment used in this span.

        The standard representation of a segment reference has the following structure:
        {catalogHrn}:{catalogVersion}:({layerId})?:{tileId}:{segmentId}(#{direction}({startOffset}..{endOffset})?)?

        The individual parts are:
        * catalogHrn: The HERE Resource Name that identifies the source catalog of the segment, example: hrn:here:data::olp-here:rib-2
        * catalogVersion: The catalog version
        * layerId (optional): The layer inside the catalog where the segment can be found, example: topology-geometry
        * tileId: The HERE tile key of the partition/tile where the segment is located in the given version of the catalog. This can be on a lower level than the actual segment is stored at (for example, the provided tile ID can be on level 14, despite topology-geometry partitions being tiled at level 12). The level of a HERE tile key is indicated by the position of the highest set bit in binary representation. Since the HERE tile key represents a morton code of the x and y portion of the Tile ID, the level 12 tile ID can be retrieved from the level 14 tile ID by removing the 4 least significant bits (or 2 bits per level) or 1 hexadecimal digit. For example, the level 14 tile 377894441 is included in the level 12 tile 23618402 (377894441<sub>10</sub> = 16863629<sub>16</sub> &rightarrow; 1686362<sub>16</sub> = 23618402<sub>10</sub>)
        * segmentId: The identifier of the referenced topology segment inside the catalog, example: here:cm:segment:84905195
        * direction (optional): Either '*' for undirected or bidirectional, '+' for positive direction, '-' for negative direction, or '?' for unknown direction (not used by the routing service)
        * startOffset/endOffset (optional): The start- and end offset are non-negative numbers between 0 and 1, representing the start and end of the referenced range using a proportion of the length of the segment. 0 represents the start and 1 the end of the segment, relative to the indicated direction (or positive direction in case of undirected segments). Example: 0.7..1

        Example of a segment reference in standard representation:
        hrn:here:data::olp-here:rib-2:1363::377894441:here:cm:segment:84905195#+0.7..1

        The segment references can also be provided in a compact representation, to reduce the response size. In the compact representation, some parts are replaced by placeholders, which can be resolved using the refReplacements dictionary in the parent section.
        The placeholder format is ```\$\d+``` and needs to be surrounded by colons or string start/end. It can be captured with the following regular expression: ```(^|:)\$\d+(:|$)/``` .

            Certain toll systems allow users to pay for the usage of the corresponding tollroads using transponders.
            As the price that the user pays with a transponder could be different from other payment methods for accessing the same toll roads
            this  is provided to allow the user to specify the transponders that they have.
            If a toll system requires a certain transponder to access it and the user states that they have it,
            the price for payment with transponders will be used when reporting fare prices
            and for summaries, if required by the `tolls[summaries]` parameter.

            The value of the parameter is a comma-separated list of transponder systems that the user has. Alternatively,
            the user can also specify `all` as a list element to state they have all required transponders along any potential route.

            No toll costs information will be returned for a given road requiring a vignette if the user states
            they already have it, as no further payment is necessary. If `tolls` are requested for spans, the toll

            Defines the emission types and CO2 emission classes as defined by the toll operator.
            The emission types defined are based on the Emission standards. Emission types are only published when the toll cost is defined based on emission type classes.

            ## Format

            Format: `EmissionType[CO2EmissionClass]`

            `EmissionType` is specified as `euro6`, `euro5`, etc. Allowed values are `[euro1, euro2, euro3, euro4, euro5, euro6, euroEev]`.

            `CO2EmissionClass` is optional and is specified as `;co2class=1`, `;co2class=2`, etc. Allowed values for `co2class` are `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

            ## Examples:

            Only toll emission type (euro6), without CO2 emission class: `euro6`

            Toll emission type (euro6) with CO2 emission class (class1): `euro6;co2class=1`

            **NOTES:**
            * This parameter is not compatible with EV routing. When EV routing is used (i.e., any `ev` namespace parameter is specified in the request or `vehicle[engineType]=electric` is specified), the appropriate emission type (Electric Vehicle) is used.
            * For cases other than EV routing: when not specified, `EmissionType` defaults to `euro5`. If `EmissionType` is provided without a `co2class`, then `co2class` defaults to `1`.
            * Providing only a `CO2EmissionClass` without an `EmissionType` is not supported, i.e. `euro6;co2class=1` is valid but `co2class=1` is invalid.
            * Providing an invalid combination of `EmissionType` and `CO2EmissionClass` as input may result in unexpected tolls.

This options is required, if `matchSideOfStreet` is set to `always`. Option cannot be combined with `radius`, `radiusPenalty` or `snapRadius`.
        * `displayLocation`: `{lat},{lng}`. Indicates the physical location of the POI. It is different from the originalLocation and location which are generally expected to be on the navigable road network, i.e., on segments.
        * `uTurnPermission`: enum `[allow, avoid]`. Specifies the U-Turn Permission mode at the stop-over waypoint. If unspecified, the permission will be determined by the global setting, avoid[features]=uTurns. This feature is not supported for pass-through waypoints and U-Turns are generally avoided in that case.
          + `allow` : Allow making a U-Turn at this stop-over waypoint
          + `avoid` : Avoid making a U-Turn at this stop-over waypoint
        * `matchSideOfStreet`: enum `[always, onlyIfDivided]`. Specifies how the location set by `sideOfStreetHint` should be handled. Requires `sideOfStreetHint` to be specified as well. Note the exception above when combined with `course`.
          + `always` : Always prefer the given side of street.
          + `onlyIfDivided`: Only prefer using side of street set by `sideOfStreetHint` in case the street has dividers. This is the default behavior.
        * `nameHint`: string. Causes the router to look for the place with the most similar name. The typical examples include: `North` being used to differentiate between interstates `I66 North` and `I66 South`, `Downtown Avenue` being used to correctly select a residental street.
        * `radius`: int, meters. Sets the radius within which all locations are considered equally eligible for selection as waypoints. Typical use cases include scenarios with imprecise coordinates or user input provided on low resolution map displays. The value is capped at 200 meters. Setting a higher value doesn't return an error. Can't be used with `snapRadius`.
        * `snapRadius`: int, meters. Sets the radius within which waypoints are matched to the most "significant" place. Candidates for matching are sorted in the order of significance which is based on the visibility on a zoomed-out map. A highway is considered more significant than a national road, while a national road is more significant than a city road. Typical use case - selecting waypoints on a  zoomed-out view of a map on a drag-and-drop interface, where only significant roads are visible. A big enough radius allows to match waypoints to such roads. Can't be used with `radius` or `radiusPenalty` parameters.
        * `radiusPenalty`: int, percentage 0-10000. Penalty as percentage: Used in conjunction with the `radius` parameter. Router will match the waypoint within the specified radius and apply a penalty to candidates based on their air distance to the waypoint. This penalty is proportional to the given percentage, where 100 is just the cost of the air distance, and 200 is twice the cost of the air distance. The penalty must be chosen so that, when multiplied by the radius, the result is less than or equal to 7200. Regardless, only values up to and including 10000 will be accepted. This means that a maximum penalty of 3600% is allowed for a radius of 200m, 7200% for 100m and 10000% for 72m and less. Higher values will result in an error response. `radiusPenalty` cannot be combined with `snapRadius`. **Alpha**: This parameter is in development. It may not be stable and is subject to change.

        * `minCourseDistance`: int, meters. Instructs the routing service to try to find a route that avoids actions for the indicated distance. For example, if the origin is determined by a moving vehicle, the user might not have time to react to early actions. Values greater than 2000 meters will be capped at 2000 meters.
        * `segmentIdHint`: string. Causes the router to try and match to the specified segment. Waypoint coordinates need to be on the segment, otherwise waypoint will be matched ignoring the segment hint. This parameter can be used when the waypoint is too close to more than one segment to force matching to a specific one.
        * `onRoadThreshold`: int, meters. allows specifying a distance within which the waypoint could be considered as being on a highway/bridge/tunnel/sliproad. Within this threshold, the attributes of the segments do not impact the matching. Outside the threshold only segments which aren't one of highway/bridge/tunnel/sliproad can be matched.

        Supported waypoint options:
        * `stopDuration`: desired duration for the stop, in seconds.
           `stopDuration` must be less than 50000.
        * `passThrough`: boolean. Asks the router to avoid the following during route calculation:
          + Introducing a stop at the waypoint.
          + Splitting the route into sections.
          + Changing the direction of travel.

        Following scenarios are not supported for `passThrough` parameter:
          + Setting both `stopDuration` to a value greater than 0 and `passThrough=true`.
          + Setting `passThrough=true` for `origin` or `destination` of a route.
          The default value is `false`.
        * `charging`: Structured string denoting a user-planned charging stop.

            Format: `charging=(power=<value>;current=<value>;voltage=<value>;supplyType=<value>;minDuration=<value>;maxDuration=<value>)`.

            The properties `power`, `current`, `voltage` and `supplyType` denote the characteristics of the chosen compatible connector at the station. These are all required.
            `minDuration` and `maxDuration` set the time bounds for the charging time. At least one of them is required. For most use cases we recommend to provide at least `minDuration`.
            The following are the specifications for the properties:
            + `power`:        value in kW, type: number. Rated power of the connector.
            + `voltage`:      value in V, type: number. Rated voltage of the connector.
            + `current`:      value in A, type: number. Rated current of the connector.
            + `supplyType`:   one of {"acSingle", "acThree", "dc"} for 1-phase AC, 3-phase AC and DC respectively, type: string.
            + `minDuration`:  value in seconds, type: int. Minimum time the user expects to charge at the station, including `chargingSetupDuration`.
            + `maxDuration`:  value in seconds, type: int. Maximum time the user plans to charge at the station, including `chargingSetupDuration`.

            For a user-planned charging stop, the following properties of the `ev` parameter are also required (see documentation for the `ev` parameter):
            + `initialCharge`
            + `maxCharge`
            + `chargingCurve`

              *Notes*:
              * This option is only supported for /v8/routes endpoint.
              * This option is not supported for pass-through waypoints.
              * If `makeReachable=true` and `minDuration` is not provided (or if `minDuration=0`), route calculation may suggest not to charge on this station, for example,
                if a better station is available in the vicinity.
              * If `stopDuration` is provided then the total time at the stop is the higher of (`stopDuration`, `chargingSetupDuration` + `chargingDuration`).
              * If charging for `minDuration` would charge above `maxCharge`, the time spent charging is capped by `maxCharge`.
              * If `stopDuration` or `minDuration` exceed `chargingSetupDuration` + `chargingDuration`, the `waiting` post action duration is set to the remaining time.
              * If `makeReachable=true` is not set, the target charge is `maxChargeAfterChargingStation`, unless the charging time would be outside of the specified duration range.
                In such case, the nearest valid value is used.
              * In getRoutesByHandle requests, the target charge from the original route response is used, unless the charging time would be outside of the specified duration range.
                In such case, the nearest valid value is used.
    WeightPerAxleGroup:
      type: string
      description: |
        Specifies the weights of different axle groups, such as single and tandem axles.

        This allows specification of axle weights in a more fine-grained way than `weightPerAxle`. This
        is relevant in countries with signs and regulations that specify different limits for different
        axle groups, such as the USA and Sweden.

        All axle group weights are evaluated against their respective axle group restrictions and against
        generic axle weight restrictions. This means that the provided tandem axle group weight is
        compared with all tandem axle group weight restrictions and all generic axle weight restrictions.
        The same is true for single, triple, quad, and quint axle groups.

        Format: `AxleGroup:Weight[,AxleGroup2:Weight2]...`

        Currently, allowed axle-groups are:
          * `single`
          * `tandem`
          * `triple`
          * `quad`
          * `quint`

        Weights are specified in kilograms (kg) and represent the total weight of the axle-group.

        **Note:** `weightPerAxleGroup` and `weightPerAxle` are incompatible.

        **Limitations:** only valid when `transportMode` is one of (`truck`, `bus`, `privateBus`).
      example: "single:11000,tandem:18000"
    WheelchairAccessibility:

        * `unknown` - Information is not available.
        * `yes` - Full unrestricted accessibility.
        * `limited` - Accessibility is limited, not everywhere or require assistance.
        * `no` - No accessibility.
      example: unknown

        features:
          type: string
          description: |
            A comma-separated list of features that routes should avoid.

            * `seasonalClosure`
            * `tollRoad`: This option avoids roads that have an applicable toll.
            * `controlledAccessHighway`
            * `ferry`
            * `carShuttleTrain`
            * `tunnel`
            * `dirtRoad`
            * `difficultTurns`: **Deprecated** (see Notes for details). This option avoids difficult turns, sharp turns and U-turns on multi-digitized roads, intersections and stopover-type waypoints. It is only supported for the `truck` transport mode.
            * `uTurns`: This option avoids U-turns on multi-digitized roads, intersections, stopover-type waypoints. U-turns on mini roundabouts (roundabouts with a small turn radius, which are difficult for long vehicles to navigate) are avoided when `transportMode = truck`. This option is not supported for pedestrian, bicycle and scooter transport modes.

            **Notes**
            - It may not always be possible to find a route which avoids the requested feature. A route may not be returned, or one may be returned with a critical notice.
            - Using `avoid[features]=tollRoad` does not optimize the route to reduce the overall toll costs.
            - Using `avoid[features]=tollRoad` is not recommended for large vehicles, e.g., trucks or buses. Even if a route is suggested, it may use smaller roads, where driving such vehicles is not convenient or safe.
            - `avoid[features]=difficultTurns` is currently deprecated and will be ignored in the future. Using `avoid[features]=difficultTurns` together with `avoid[features]=controlledAccessHighway` or `avoid[features]=tollRoads` is not recommended, as it may lead to routes which could include difficult turns.
        areas:

        segments:
          type: string
          description: |
            A comma separated list of segment identifiers that routes should avoid going through.

            Each entry has the following structure:
            `{segmentId}(#{direction})?`

            The individual parts are:
            * segmentId: The identifier of the referenced topology segment inside the catalog, example: `here:cm:segment:207551710`
            * direction (optional): Either '*' for bidirectional (default), '+' for positive direction, or '-' for negative direction

            Example of a parameter value excluding two segments:
            `here:cm:segment:207551710#+,here:cm:segment:76771992#*`

            **Note**: Maximum number of penalized segments in one request should not be greater than 1000.
                      "Penalized segments" refers to segments that either have a restriction on maximum baseSpeed with `maxSpeedOnSegment`
                      or avoided with `avoid[segments]`
        zoneCategories:
          type: string
          description: |
            Specifies a list of categories of zones which routes should avoid going through.

            Format: `Categories[ZoneCategoryOptions]`

            * Categories: `{cat1},{cat2}...`
              A comma separated list of zone categories.
            * ZoneCategoriesOptions (optional): `;option1=value1;options2=value2...`
              A list of options for zone categories in `KEY=VALUE` form.

            Supported zone category options:
              * exceptZoneIds: A comma-separated list of zone identifiers, which should not be taken into account for evaluation of zone categories to avoid.

            Supported zone categories:
              * `vignette`
              * `congestionPricing`
              * `environmental`

            **Note**: Zones that don't apply to the current vehicle aren't avoided.
            Time-dependent zones are avoided only during the validity period.

            Example of zone categories avoidance:
            `avoid[zoneCategories]=environmental,vignette`

            Example of zone categories avoidance with exceptions:
            `avoid[zoneCategories]=environmental,vignette;exceptZoneIds=here:cm:envzone:3`
        zoneIdentifiers:
          type: string
          description: |
            A comma separated list containing identifiers of zones that routes should avoid going through.

            **Note**: Zones specified by id in this manner are avoided even if their conditions don't apply to the current vehicle.
            Time-dependent zones are avoided by id even outside of the validity period.

            Example of an identifier referencing an environmental zone:
            `here:cm:envzone:2`
        truckRoadTypes:
          type: string
          description: |
            A comma-separated list of truck road type identifiers to be avoided.

            A truck road type is an identifier associated with roads that have additional regulations applied by local administration for traversal by heavy vehicles like trucks.
            For example, the BK Bearing Class regulations in Sweden, and ET categories in Mexico.
            Identifiers for supported truck road types are specified in HERE Map Content
            [TruckRoadType](https://www.here.com/docs/bundle/map-content-schema-data-specification/page/topics_schema/truckroadtypeattribute.html).

            Example: `avoid[truckRoadTypes]=BK1,BK2,BK3,BK4`

        tollTransponders:
          type: string
          description: |
            Specifies that routes should avoid roads where the specified toll transponders are the only payment method.

            The value of the parameter is a comma-separated list of transponder systems that the user has. Alternatively,
            the user can also specify `all` as a list element to state they have all required transponders along any potential route.

          type: string
          description: |
            Function curve describing the maximum battery charging rate (in kW) at a given charge level (in kWh).

            The format of the string is a comma-separated list of numbers, as follows:

            ```
            <CHARGE_0>,<RATE_0>,<CHARGE_1>,<RATE_1>,...,<RATE_N>,<CHARGE_N>
            ```

            where charge values are strictly increasing, non-negative floating-point values in units
            of (kWh), and rate values are positive floating point values in units of (kW).

            Charge values must cover the entire range of `[0, maxChargeAfterChargingStation`]. The
            charging curve is piecewise constant, e.g., for any charge in the range `[CHARGE_0,
            CHARGE_1)`, the value of the function is `RATE_0`.

            Maximum value of rate must not be greater than 2000 kW. The values of charge in the curve are only validated up to the value of `maxChargeAfterChargingStation` since values outside this range are not used.
            Minimum value of rate must not be less than 7kW. The values of charge in the curve are only validated up to the value of `maxChargeAfterChargingStation` since values outside this range are not used.

            The algorithm calculates a route as the best possible combination of driving and charging
            parts and uses the charging curve to evaluate the most efficent range of
            charging. For example, if the rate of charging is high at lower levels of battery, but slows down significantly after charging a little, stopping
            often and charging less, but quicker, at each station might be better for the overall route.
            Because batteries lose charging speed with use, providing a charging curve for the
            exact battery would give more accurate charging time estimate than providing a
            generic curve for all batteries of one type.
          example: "0,207,28.761,207,29.011,173,43.493,173,43.743,145,51.209,145,51.459,113,56.120,113,56.370,87,80.0,10"

          type: number
          description: |
            Maximum charge to which the battery should be charged at a charging station (in kWh).
            Value must be less than or equal to the value of `maxCharge`.

            The algorithm calculates a route as the best possible combination of driving and charging
            parts so charging at a charging station does not happen strictly to the value of
            this parameter. Instead, the algorithm attempts to leave every station with
            different charge levels, and only the best possible combination of charging stations
            and target charge will form the final route.

            For example, if there is a fast but not reachable charging station on the route,
            the algorithm prefers first to charge at a slower station, but only to a level that enables it
            to reach the fast station. This way it calculates the best possible combination of driving
            and charging parts.
        minChargeAtChargingStation:
          minimum: 0
          type: number
          description: |
            Minimum charge when arriving at a charging station (in kWh).
            Value must be less than the value of `maxChargeAfterChargingStation`.

            The algorithm calculates a route as the best possible combination of driving and charging
            parts so visiting a charging station is planned not when the remaining charge is close
            to the value of this parameter but when it is part of the best possible charging
            plan for the given route.

            For example, it might prefer charging a still half-full battery at the fast charging station because
            there are only slower stations later on the route and the remaining charge is not
            enough to reach the destination without charging at all.
        minChargeAtFirstChargingStation:

          description: |
            Minimum charge when arriving at first charging station (in kWh).
            Value must be less than the value of `maxChargeAfterChargingStation`.

            This overrides `minChargeAtChargingStation` for the first charging station. If not specified, `minChargeAtChargingStation`
            will be used for all charging stations, including the first one.

            This is usually used when the current charge is too low to reach a charging station within `minChargeAtChargingStation` limits.
        minChargeAtDestination:
          minimum: 0
          type: number
          description: |
            Minimum charge at the final route destination (in kWh).
            Value must be less than the value of `maxChargeAfterChargingStation`.

            The algorithm calculates a route as the best possible combination of driving and charging
            parts while making sure that the actual value of the charge at the destination would be close to the
            value of this parameter. I.e., the resulting value is expected to be bigger
            than this parameter's value by no more than 10% of the battery capacity.

            For stations with multiple compatible connectors, the charging time is based on the connector type with the highest power rating among them.

            Currently supported connector types are:
              * `iec62196Type1Combo`:  Type 1 Combo connector, commonly called "CCS1"

            Function curve describing the maximum battery charging rate (in kW) at a given charge level (in kWh).

            The format of the string is a comma-separated list of numbers, as follows:

            ```
            <CHARGE_0>,<RATE_0>,<CHARGE_1>,<RATE_1>,...,<RATE_N>,<CHARGE_N>
            ```

            where charge values are strictly increasing, non-negative floating-point values in units
            of (kWh), and rate values are positive floating point values in units of (kW).

            Charge values must cover the entire range of `[0, maxChargeAfterChargingStation`]. The
            charging curve is piecewise constant, e.g., for any charge in the range `[CHARGE_0,
            CHARGE_1)`, the value of the function is `RATE_0`.

            Maximum value of rate must not be greater than 2000 kW. The values of charge in the curve are only validated up to the value of `maxChargeAfterChargingStation` since values outside this range are not used.
            Minimum value of rate must not be less than 7kW. The values of charge in the curve are only validated up to the value of `maxChargeAfterChargingStation` since values outside this range are not used.

            The algorithm calculates a route as the best possible combination of driving and charging
            parts and uses the charging curve to evaluate the most efficent range of
            charging. For example, if the rate of charging is high at lower levels of battery, but slows down significantly after charging a little, stopping
            often and charging less, but quicker, at each station might be better for the overall route.
            Because batteries lose charging speed with use, providing a charging curve for the
            exact battery would give more accurate charging time estimate than providing a
            generic curve for all batteries of one type.
          example: "0,207,28.761,207,29.011,173,43.493,173,43.743,145,51.209,145,51.459,113,56.120,113,56.370,87,80.0,10"
        maxChargingVoltage:
          maximum: 2000
          minimum: 0
          type: number
          description: |
            Maximum charging voltage supported by the vehicle's battery (in Volt).
        maxChargingCurrent:
          maximum: 2000
          minimum: 0
          type: number
          description: |
            Maximum charging current supported by the vehicle's battery (in Ampere).
        maxChargeAfterChargingStation:
          minimum: 0
          type: number
          description: |
            Maximum charge to which the battery should be charged at a charging station (in kWh).
            Value must be less than or equal to the value of `maxCharge`.

            The algorithm calculates a route as the best possible combination of driving and charging
            parts so charging at a charging station does not happen strictly to the value of
            this parameter. Instead, the algorithm attempts to leave every station with
            different charge levels, and only the best possible combination of charging stations
            and target charge will form the final route.

            For example, if there is a fast but not reachable charging station on the route,
            the algorithm prefers first to charge at a slower station, but only to a level that enables it
            to reach the fast station. This way it calculates the best possible combination of driving
            and charging parts.
        minChargeAtChargingStation:
          minimum: 0
          type: number
          description: |
            Minimum charge when arriving at a charging station (in kWh).
            Value must be less than the value of `maxChargeAfterChargingStation`.

            The algorithm calculates a route as the best possible combination of driving and charging
            parts so visiting a charging station is planned not when the remaining charge is close
            to the value of this parameter but when it is part of the best possible charging
            plan for the given route.

            For example, it might prefer charging a still half-full battery at the fast charging station because
            there are only slower stations later on the route and the remaining charge is not
            enough to reach the destination without charging at all.
        minChargeAtFirstChargingStation:
          minimum: 0
          type: number
          description: |
            Minimum charge when arriving at first charging station (in kWh).
            Value must be less than the value of `maxChargeAfterChargingStation`.

            This overrides `minChargeAtChargingStation` for the first charging station. If not specified, `minChargeAtChargingStation`
            will be used for all charging stations, including the first one.

            This is usually used when the current charge is too low to reach a charging station within `minChargeAtChargingStation` limits.
        minChargeAtDestination:
          minimum: 0
          type: number
          description: |
            Minimum charge at the final route destination (in kWh).
            Value must be less than the value of `maxChargeAfterChargingStation`.

            The algorithm calculates a route as the best possible combination of driving and charging
            parts while making sure that the actual value of the charge at the destination would be close to the
            value of this parameter. I.e., the resulting value is expected to be bigger
            than this parameter's value by no more than 10% of the battery capacity.

            then only stations with any of these connector types will be evaluated as a potential charging stop.
            For stations with multiple compatible connectors, the charging time is based on the connector type with the highest power rating among them.

            Currently supported connector types are:
              * `iec62196Type1Combo`:  Type 1 Combo connector, commonly called "CCS1"
              * `iec62196Type2Combo`:  Type 2 Combo connector, commonly called "CCS2"

            * The vehicle's `maxChargingVoltage` >= 800 V.

            The `consumablePower` at a station is then taken to be the lower of `maxPowerAtLowVoltage` and the charging station's available power.

    EVConsumption:
      description: |
        EV properties to be used for calculating consumption.

        There are two consumption models (`empirical`, `physical`). Set the `consumptionModel` parameter to choose which model to use.

        Required `empirical` model properties:
        * `freeFlowSpeedTable`

        Required `physical` model properties:
        * `driveEfficiency`
        * `recuperationEfficiency`

        When using the physical model, certain properties of the `vehicle` parameter are also required (see documentation for the `vehicle` parameter for more details):
        * `rollingResistanceCoefficient`
        * `airDragCoefficient`
        * `currentWeight`
        * `frontalArea` or combination of `width` and `height`

        The following `ev` properties are additionally required in order to calculate State-of-Charge along the route:
        * `initialCharge`
        * `maxCharge`

        Route reachability based on State-of-Charge will be evaluated for the following constraints, if additionally provided,
        * `minChargeAtDestination`
        * `minChargeAtFirstChargingStation`
        * `minChargeAtChargingStation`

        The following properties are additionally required in order to calculate charging at charging station waypoints (see documentation for `via` parameter)
        * `chargingCurve`

        **Notes**:
        * Hybrid vehicles (EV + Other fuel types) are not supported. Consumption properties are not supported for combination of `ev` and `fuel` vehicles.
        * EV parameters are not supported in combination with pedestrian and bicycle `transportMode`.

        makeReachable:
          type: boolean
          description: |
            When set to `true`, the router ensures that the calculated route is reachable within the given constraints
            (i.e., `minChargeAtChargingStation`, `minChargeAtDestination`). If necessary, charging stations are added to the route
            to achieve reachability.

            The following conditions must be met in order to enable this option:
            * `routingMode=fast`
            * `transportMode=car` or `transportMode=truck` (Beta)

            Support for this feature with `transportMode=truck` is currently in beta release, with the following limitations:
            * `avoid[features]=controlledAccessHighway` and `avoid[features]=tollRoad` in combination with `transportMode=truck` are supported only for `vehicle[grossWeight]` up to 7500 kg.
            * Trucks above 4200 kg are limited to following countries:
              - Germany
              - Netherlands
              - Belgium
              - Luxembourg

              - Switzerland
              - Austria
              - Liechtenstein

              This is mainly because the coverage of charging station data for trucks is limited outside of these countries.
            * For trucks up to 7500 kg the coverage of charging stations can be improved by including car charging stations by specifying `ev[allowCarChargingStations]=true`. This will also enable routing in countries other than the ones listed above.
            * Quality of the resulting routes and performance of the calculation is not guaranteed.

            **Note**:
            * When setting avoid[areas] option, the route calculation may fail if route has to take significant detour to avoid them.

            ## Supported E-Mobility Service Provider IDs

            * A valid E-Mobility Service Provider ID
            * `default`: special value to be used in place of an id, to model default behavior when a station doesn't support any of the specified E-Mobility Service Providers.
              The preference level passed with `default` is applied to such stations. This value must be lowest of all preferences.
              If a `default` preference level is not specified, the value `exclude` is applied to the stations under this category.


            ## Supported preference levels

            *`high`: Stations that support E-Mobility Service Providers with `high` preference level are preferred over all other stations. At least one Provider must be specified with this level.
            * `medium`: Stations supporting E-Mobility Service Providers with `medium` preference level are considered only in case the vehicle cannot reach stations supporting Providers with `high` level.
            * `low`: Stations supporting only E-Mobility Service Providers with `low` preference level are preferred the least and such stations are considered only in case the vehicle cannot reach stations that support Providers with `high` or `medium` level.
            * `exclude`: Can only be used as the `default` preference level. When `exclude` is the `default`, stations that are not assigned a higher preference are never considered.

            **Note**:
            * Maximum number of IDs that can be preferred is limited to 10.

        EV properties to be used for calculating consumption.

        There are two consumption models (`empirical`, `physical`). Set the `consumptionModel` parameter to choose which model to use.

        Required `empirical` model properties:
        * `freeFlowSpeedTable`

        Required `physical` model properties:
        * `driveEfficiency`
        * `recuperationEfficiency`

        When using the physical model, certain properties of the `vehicle` parameter are also required (see documentation for the `vehicle` parameter for more details):
        * `rollingResistanceCoefficient`
        * `airDragCoefficient`
        * `currentWeight`
        * `frontalArea` or combination of `width` and `height`

        The following `ev` properties are additionally required in order to calculate State-of-Charge along the route:
        * `initialCharge`
        * `maxCharge`

        Route reachability based on State-of-Charge will be evaluated for the following constraints, if additionally provided,
        * `minChargeAtDestination`
        * `minChargeAtFirstChargingStation`
        * `minChargeAtChargingStation`

        The following properties are additionally required in order to calculate charging at charging station waypoints (see documentation for `via` parameter)
        * `chargingCurve`

        **Notes**:
        * Hybrid vehicles (EV + Other fuel types) are not supported. Consumption properties are not supported for combination of `ev` and `fuel` vehicles.
        * EV parameters are not supported in combination with pedestrian and bicycle `transportMode`.

        The following properties are additionally required for the router to automatically enhance the route with charging stops
        * `makeReachable` set to `true`
        * `chargingCurve`
        * `connectorTypes`

              E-Mobility Service Providers with high preference.
            * `low`: Stations supporting only low preference level E-Mobility Service Providers are preferred the least and such stations
              are chosen only in case the vehicle cannot reach stations that support E-Mobility Service Providers with high or medium preference.
            * `exclude`: stations that only support E-Mobility Service Providers with this preference level are never selected as a charging stop.

            **Notes**:
            * Maximum number of E-Mobility Service Providers in preferences is limited to 10
            * In routeHandle request this affects only value of matchingEMobilityServiceProviders in the response. The route is not affected in any way.

        EV properties to be used for calculating consumption.

        There are two consumption models (`empirical`, `physical`). Set the `consumptionModel` parameter to choose which model to use.

        Required `empirical` model properties:
        * `freeFlowSpeedTable`

        Required `physical` model properties:
        * `driveEfficiency`
        * `recuperationEfficiency`

        When using the physical model, certain properties of the `vehicle` parameter are also required (see documentation for the `vehicle` parameter for more details):
        * `rollingResistanceCoefficient`
        * `airDragCoefficient`
        * `currentWeight`
        * `frontalArea` or combination of `width` and `height`

        The following `ev` properties are additionally required in order to calculate State-of-Charge along the route:
        * `initialCharge`
        * `maxCharge`

        Route reachability based on State-of-Charge will be evaluated for the following constraints, if additionally provided,
        * `minChargeAtDestination`
        * `minChargeAtFirstChargingStation`
        * `minChargeAtChargingStation`

        The following properties are additionally required in order to calculate charging at charging station waypoints (see documentation for `via` parameter)
        * `chargingCurve`

        **Notes**:
        * Hybrid vehicles (EV + Other fuel types) are not supported. Consumption properties are not supported for combination of `ev` and `fuel` vehicles.
        * EV parameters are not supported in combination with pedestrian and bicycle `transportMode`.

            toll system name. But for a toll cost associated with multiple toll systems this parameter will return the name of
            only one toll system. To get the names of all the toll systems associated with a toll cost use `TollCost.tollSystems`.

            * This value represents the operational (tank-to-wheel) carbon dioxide emission.
            * This value represents only the carbon dioxide emission and does not represent the carbon dioxide equivalent emission for other gases or particulates.
            * This value is calculated based on `fuel[type]`, the `consumption` for the given route section and the `fuel emission factor` provided in this document. The calculation does not adhere to any other standards (e.g. ISO 14083, etc.).
            * `co2Emission` is only returned for `fuel` based vehicle.

            Emission factors for different fuel types:

            * `diesel`: Diesel. Emission is 2.697 kg of CO2 from each combusted liter of fuel.
            * `petrol`: Petrol/gasoline. Emission is 2.319 kg of CO2 from each combusted liter of fuel.
            * `lpg`: LPG. Emission is 1.5 kg of CO2 from each combusted liter of fuel.
            * `cng`: CNG. Emission is 2.529 kg of CO2 from each combusted kilogram of fuel.
            * `lng`: LNG. Emission is 1.189 kg of CO2 from each combusted liter of fuel.
            * `ethanol`: Ethanol (100%). Emission is 1.519 kg of CO2 from each combusted liter of fuel.
            * `propane`: Propane. Emission is 1.511 kg of CO2 from each combusted liter of fuel.

            The duration, specified in seconds, based on the region-specific machine learning model.

            `mlDuration` is calculated for each route section of the route.
            If a section of the route is not supported, `mlDuration` will not be present in the summary of that section. Instead, a notice with the reason will be provided.
            `mlDuration` is only calculated for the entire section. The sum of span durations is not equivalent to `mlDuration`.
            **Limitations:**
              * Only valid for `transportMode=car` or `transportMode=taxi`.
              * Only valid for `traffic[mode]=default`.
              * Invalid for `departureTime=any`.

        co2Emission:

            Estimation of the carbon dioxide emission for the given route section. Unit is kilograms with precision to three decimal places.

            Definitions:

            * Total Emission (Well-to-Wheel) = Production Emission (Well-to-Tank) + Operational Emission (Tank-to-Wheel)
            * CO2 Equivalent Emission (CO2e for CH4, N2O, etc.) = Gas Emission * Global Warming Potential (GWP)

            **Notes:**

            * This value represents the operational (tank-to-wheel) carbon dioxide emission.
            * This value represents only the carbon dioxide emission and does not represent the carbon dioxide equivalent emission for other gases or particulates.
            * This value is calculated based on `fuel[type]`, the `consumption` for the given route section and the `fuel emission factor` provided in this document. The calculation does not adhere to any other standards (e.g. ISO 14083, etc.).
            * `co2Emission` is only returned for `fuel` based vehicle.

            Emission factors for different fuel types:

            * `diesel`: Diesel. Emission is 2.697 kg of CO2 from each combusted liter of fuel.
            * `petrol`: Petrol/gasoline. Emission is 2.319 kg of CO2 from each combusted liter of fuel.
            * `lpg`: LPG. Emission is 1.5 kg of CO2 from each combusted liter of fuel.
            * `cng`: CNG. Emission is 2.529 kg of CO2 from each combusted kilogram of fuel.
            * `lng`: LNG. Emission is 1.189 kg of CO2 from each combusted liter of fuel.
            * `ethanol`: Ethanol (100%). Emission is 1.519 kg of CO2 from each combusted liter of fuel.
            * `propane`: Propane. Emission is 1.511 kg of CO2 from each combusted liter of fuel.
            * `hydrogen`: Hydrogen (emission for production is not considered). Emission is 0 kg of CO2 from each combusted liter of fuel.

        Avoid roads that violate certain features of road network or that go through
        user-specified areas, segments, or zones.

        Note that if the origin, destination, or any via is in an avoided area or on an avoided
        feature, a route is produced that violates the avoid restriction. In such a case, the
        route is trying to minimize the violation of the avoid restrictions and can therefore
        include large deviations from a route that is calculated without these avoid
        restrictions.

        It is also possible that the produced route violates the avoid restriction in between
        waypoints, if no other route is possible or too hard to find. One such example is
        requesting a route to an island that is only reachable with ferries while specifying
        `avoid[features]=ferry`.

        When using avoid features, it's not guaranteed to get alternatives. Further, they can even
        cause the route calculation to fail, if no route is possible or too hard to find.

        * `recuperationEfficiency`

        When using the physical model, certain properties of the `vehicle` parameter are also required (see documentation for the `vehicle` parameter for more details):
        * `rollingResistanceCoefficient`
        * `airDragCoefficient`
        * `currentWeight`
        * `frontalArea` or combination of `width` and `height`

        The following `ev` properties are additionally required in order to calculate State-of-Charge along the route:
        * `initialCharge`
        * `maxCharge`

        Route reachability based on State-of-Charge will be evaluated for the following constraints, if additionally provided,
        * `minChargeAtDestination`
        * `minChargeAtFirstChargingStation`
        * `minChargeAtChargingStation`

        The following properties are additionally required in order to calculate charging at charging station waypoints (see documentation for `via` parameter)
        * `chargingCurve`

        **Notes**:
        * Hybrid vehicles (EV + Other fuel types) are not supported. Consumption properties are not supported for combination of `ev` and `fuel` vehicles.
        * EV parameters are not supported in combination with pedestrian and bicycle `transportMode`.

        **Note**: Route import does not support adding charging stations, therefore the following related parameters are ignored:
        * chargingCurve
        * maxChargingVoltage
        * maxChargingCurrent
        * maxChargeAfterChargingStation
        * minChargeAtChargingStation

        ## Format

        Format: `Place[WaypointOptions]`

        * Place: `{lat},{lng}[PlaceOptions]`
        * PlaceOptions: `;option1=<value1>;option2=<value2>...`
        * WaypointOptions: `!option1=<value1>!option2=<value2>...`

        A waypoint consists of:

        * Exactly one place
        * Optional settings for the place
        * Optional settings for the waypoint itself

        ## Supported place options

        * `course`: int, degrees clock-wise from north. Indicating desired direction at the place.
          E.g. `90` indicating `east`. Often combined with `radius` and/or `minCourseDistance`
        * `sideOfStreetHint`: `{lat},{lng}`. Indicating the side of the street that should be
          used. E.g. if the location is to the left of the street, the router will prefer using
          that side in case the street has dividers. E.g.
          `52.511496,13.304140;sideOfStreetHint=52.512149,13.304076` indicates that the `north`
          side of the street should be preferred. This option is required, if `matchSideOfStreet`
          is set to `always`.
          Option cannot be combined with `radius`, `radiusPenalty` or `snapRadius`.
        * `displayLocation`: `{lat},{lng}`. Indicates the location on the map where this POI is to be displayed. This attribute is passed through to the `displayLocation` attribute in the corresponding `Place` object in the output.
        * `uTurnPermission`: enum `[allow, avoid]`. Specifies the U-Turn Permission mode at the stop-over waypoint. If unspecified, the permission will be determined by the global setting, avoid[features]=uTurns. This feature is not supported for pass-through waypoints and U-Turns are generally avoided in that case.
          + `allow` : Allow making a U-Turn at this stop-over waypoint
          + `avoid` : Avoid making a U-Turn at this stop-over waypoint
        * `matchSideOfStreet`: enum `[always, onlyIfDivided]`. Specifies how the location set by
          `sideOfStreetHint` should be handled. Requires `sideOfStreetHint` to be specified as
          well.
          + `always` : Always prefer the given side of street.
          + `onlyIfDivided`: Only prefer using side of street set by `sideOfStreetHint` in case
            the street has dividers. This is the default behavior.
        * `nameHint`: string. Causes the router to look for the place with the most similar name.
          The typical examples include: `North` being used to differentiate between
          interstates `I66 North` and `I66 South`, `Downtown Avenue` being used to correctly
          select a residental street.

          Empty string values are ignored.
        * `radius`: int, meters. Asks the router to consider all places within the given radius as
          potential candidates for route calculation. This can be either because it is not
          important which place is used, or because it is unknown. Radiuses wider than 200 meters are
          not supported.
          Option cannot be combined with `snapRadius`.
        * `radiusPenalty`: int, percentage 0-10000. Penalty as percentage: Used in conjunction with the `radius`
          parameter. Router will match the waypoint within the specified radius and apply a penalty to candidates
          based on their air distance to the waypoint. This penalty is proportional to the given percentage,
          where 100 is just the cost of the air distance, and 200 is twice the cost of the air distance. The penalty
          must be chosen so that, when multiplied by the radius, the result is less than or equal to 7200.
          Regardless, only values up to and including 10000 will be accepted. This means that a maximum penalty
          of 3600% is allowed for a radius of 200m, 7200% for 100m and 10000% for 72m and less.
          Higher values will result in an error response. `radiusPenalty` cannot be combined with `snapRadius`.
          **Alpha**: This parameter is in development. It may not be stable and is subject to change.
        * `snapRadius`: int, meters. Instructs the router to match the waypoint, within the specified radius,
          to the most "significant" road. In contrast to the regular `radius` parameter, `snapRadius` sorts potential
          candidates in order of "significance". For example, a highway is more significant on a zoomed-out map than
          a national road, a national road is more significant than a city road, etc. Hence, `snapRadius` cannot be
          combined with `radius` or `radiusPenalty` parameters. The typical use case for `snapRadius` is when selecting a waypoint on a
          zoomed-out view of a map on a drag-and-drop interface. The expectation on such UIs is that only roads that
          are visible at that zoom level are considered for matching and a large snapRadius would enable that.
        * `minCourseDistance`: int, meters. Instructs the routing service to try to find a route that avoids actions for the indicated distance.
          For example, if the origin is determined by a moving vehicle, the user might not have time to react to early actions.
          Values greater than 2000 meters will be capped at 2000 meters.
        * `customizationIndex`: int. Specifies the zero-based index into the list of customizations
          specified in the `customizations` parameter. The customization at that index must be an
          Extension Map.
          Providing a `customizationIndex` indicates the this waypoint is located within that
          Extension Map.
          **Alpha**: This customization API parameter is in development. It may not be stable and is subject to change.
        * `segmentIdHint`: string. Causes the router to try and match to the specified segment.
          Waypoint coordinates need to be on the segment, otherwise waypoint will be matched ignoring the segment hint
          This parameter can be used when the waypoint is too close to more than one segment to force matching to a specific one.
        * `onRoadThreshold`: int, meters. allows specifying a distance within which
          the waypoint could be considered as being on a highway/bridge/tunnel/sliproad.
          Within this threshold, the attributes of the segments do not impact the matching.
          Outside the threshold only segments which aren't one of highway/bridge/tunnel/sliproad can be matched.

        ## Notes

        * `origin` currently does not support any WaypointOptions. They are available for `via` and `destination` waypoints.
        * Non-structural reserved characters in options' values need to be properly percent-encoded.
          Please refer to the Developer Guide for more details.

          If tolls cannot be calculated for a section, it will contain the `tollsDataUnavailable` notice code.

          **Note**:
            - Toll requests support `car` dimensions such as atypical car height and weight, trailers, axle count and vehicle fuel type. However extreme parameter combinations may result in tolls being returned for a different vehicle type (for example, a car with 6 axles will most likely result in truck tolls).
            Therefore the request will return the most "typical" toll cost for the parameters provided.
            - Tolls are not available in route import service. See [this tutorial](https://www.here.com/docs/bundle/routing-api-developer-guide-v8/page/tutorials/tolls-routeimport.html) for information on how to request tolls when using route import.
        * `routeLabels` - Include a list of the most important names and route numbers on this route that differentiate it from other alternatives
        * `potentialTimeDependentViolations` - Include info notices for potential time-dependent violations in the sections that match the current vehicle profile, but are not violating the restricted times for the calculated route.
        * `noThroughRestrictions` - Include information about the parts of the route that are not allowed to be driven through, i.e. route can only start, end, or have an intermediate `via` waypoint here.

        The following restrictions apply when specifying the `return` parameter:

        * If `actions` is requested, then `polyline` must also be requested as well.
        * If `instructions` is requested, then `actions` must also be requested as well.

        Scooter-specific parameters.
          * `allowHighway`: Specifies whether the scooter is allowed on highways or not. This parameter is optional.
            If not provided, the default is to avoid highways.
            There is a similar parameter avoid[features]=controlledAccessHighway to disallow highway usage.
            avoid[features] takes precedence, so if that parameter is also used, scooters are not allowed
            to use highways even if `allowHighway` is set to `true`.
            The following values are possible:
              * `true`: The scooter is allowed to use highways.
              * `false`: The scooter is not allowed to use highways.

      name: via
      in: query
      description: |
        A location defining a via waypoint.

        A via waypoint is a location between origin and destination. There are two types of via waypoints:
        * `passThrough=false` (default) : The route will stop at the via waypoint, creating a new route section.
        * `passThrough=true` : The route will pass through the via waypoint.

        Multiple waypoints can be specified by using multiple via parameters like
        `via=...&via=...`, in which case the route will traverse these waypoints sequentially in
        the order specified in the request.

        For a description of the format and options for this parameter, please refer to the description of
        the `origin` parameter.
        `via` supports the same options as the `origin` parameter, with the following exceptions:

        ## Additional waypoint options:
        * `stopDuration`: desired duration for the stop, in seconds. Must be less than 50000.
        * `passThrough`: boolean. Default value is `false`.
           Setting to `true` asks the router to avoid the following during route calculation:
          + Introducing a stop at the waypoint.
          + Splitting the route into sections.
          + Changing the direction of travel.

          The following scenarios are not supported for `passThrough` parameter:
          + Setting both `stopDuration` to a value greater than 0 and `passThrough=true`.

        * `charging`: Structured string denoting a user-planned charging stop.

          Format: `charging=(power=<value>;current=<value>;voltage=<value>;supplyType=<value>;minDuration=<value>;maxDuration=<value>)`.

          The properties `power`, `current`, `voltage` and `supplyType` denote the characteristics of the chosen compatible connector at the station. These are all required.
          `minDuration` and `maxDuration` set the time bounds for the charging time. At least one of them is required. For most use cases we recommend to provide at least `minDuration`.
          The following are the specifications for the properties:
          + `power`:        value in kW, type: number. Rated power of the connector.
          + `voltage`:      value in V, type: number. Rated voltage of the connector.
          + `current`:      value in A, type: number. Rated current of the connector.
          + `supplyType`:   one of {"acSingle", "acThree", "dc"} for 1-phase AC, 3-phase AC and DC respectively, type: string.
          + `minDuration`:  value in seconds, type: int. Minimum time the user expects to charge at the station, including `chargingSetupDuration`. This value takes precedence over the global `maxChargingDuration`.
          + `maxDuration`:  value in seconds, type: int. Maximum time the user plans to charge at the station, including `chargingSetupDuration`. This value takes precedence over the global `maxChargingDuration`.

          For a user-planned charging stop, the following properties of the `ev` parameter are also required (see documentation for the `ev` parameter):
          * `initialCharge`
          * `maxCharge`
          * `chargingCurve`

          *Notes*:
            * This option is not supported for pass-through waypoints.
            * If `makeReachable=true` and `minDuration` is not provided (or if `minDuration=0`), route calculation may suggest not to charge on this station, for example,
              if a better station is available in the vicinity.
            * If `stopDuration` is provided then the total time at the stop is the higher of (`stopDuration`, `chargingSetupDuration` + `chargingDuration`).
            * If charging for `minDuration` would charge above `maxCharge`, the time spent charging is capped by `maxCharge`.
            * If `stopDuration` or `minDuration` exceed `chargingSetupDuration` + `chargingDuration`, the `waiting` post action duration is set to the remaining time.
            * If `makeReachable=true` is not set, the target charge is `maxChargeAfterChargingStation`, unless the charging time would be outside of the specified duration range.
              In such case, the nearest valid value is used.
            * In getRoutesByHandle requests, the target charge from the original route response is used, unless the charging time would be outside of the specified duration range.
              In such case, the nearest valid value is used.

        * `currentWeightChange`: Changes the value of `vehicle[currentWeight]` by this value. Enables the support of scenarios where the vehicle takes additional cargo or unloads its cargo along the route. Changes to the configuration of the vehicle, such as adding a trailer, aren't supported.
        Relative value in kilograms, beginning with either `+` or `-`. Available range: from -40000 to +40000 (inclusive).

           If this parameter is specified on any of the via waypoints or the request has the `vehicle[currentWeight]` set, the response contains the `currentWeight` value used for each section.

           When this parameter is provided, both `vehicle[currentWeight]` and `vehicle[grossWeight]` must also be provided.

           If the `currentWeight` value falls below 0 due to `currentWeightChange`, the system returns a critical violation notice, but a route is still calculated. The system returns notices only for negative values. Very low positive values are likely invalid, but don't trigger notices since they are greater than 0.

           The `currentWeightChange` value is stored in the `RouteHandle` at each waypoint and can't be changed in `RouteHandle` calculation requests.
